# SVM
SVM for classification, without and with kernels
In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification. We are going to use the famous MNIST dataset, that is a dataset of handwritten digits. We get the data from mldata.org, that is a public repository for machine learning data.
The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (i.e., 0, 1, ... 9). Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels and we can think of it as a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers. Each number is an integer between 0 and 255. For each image we have the corresponding label (i.e., 0, 1, ..., 9).
